## Getting Started

To initiate this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/noah-sheldon/marketing-firm-accessibile-landing-page.git
   ```

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
